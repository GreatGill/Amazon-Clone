**Project Title:** Amazon.com Homepage Clone

**Description:**
Welcome to my rendition of the Amazon.com homepage clone! This project is a showcase of my HTML and CSS skills, where I've meticulously crafted a replica of one of the world's most popular e-commerce websites.

- **Responsive Design:** The clone is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless browsing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **Custom Styling:** I've utilized CSS to style the elements, incorporating Amazon's iconic color scheme, fonts, and layout principles.
- **Interactive Elements:** While this clone is static, it demonstrates the potential for interactivity with hover effects, clickable links, and form inputs.
